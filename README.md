I used the Xpert Learning Assistant a lot to help out with this code. Mostly just to help find which class notes I needed to look at. While I did have the Xpert AI write some code out for me, it wasn't directly copied. It was mostly just to affirm what I had was correct. I did not use anything else but class notes and the Xpert Learning Assisstant though.
